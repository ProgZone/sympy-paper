Style TODOs:

- Add hyphenation entries for all unknown words.

- Clean and consistent tables.

- Syntax highlighting of code (one option: pygments can output to tex).

- Consistent example formatting (>>> style, str printer, note at beginning
  that "from sympy import *" is assumed).

- Avoid too much itemize.

- "Other projects that use SymPy" section should use a table.

Content TODOs:

- De-duplicate content in assumptions architecture section and assumptions
  features section.

- Mention all major algorithms that are implemented, even if they aren't
  discussed in-depth.

- Write the Gruntz algorithm section as actual text.

- Clean up "basic operations".

- Move "sets" details in to citations/supplement.

- Move solvers details into citations/supplement.

- Clean up matrices section.

- Move series stuff to supplement.

- Move logic stuff to supplement.

- Move vector and physics stuff to supplement.

- Move SymPy Gamma/Live stuff to supplement.

- Either flesh out CAS comparison section with other CASs or move to
  supplement.

- Address all inline TODOs in the .tex files.

Citations:

- Make sure everything that needs to be cited is cited.

- Make sure the citations we have are good ones. We should avoid software
citations and "URL citations".

- "Other projects that use SymPy" needs real citations (not URLs)

- Fix citation of Mathematica.

Sections that need to be written:

- Abstract (note: write this last)

- Introduction

- Polynomials module architecture (if we can't get anyone to write it, add a
  blurb and cite Mateusz's thesis)

- Something on printers

- Conclusion
