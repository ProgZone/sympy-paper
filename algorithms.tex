% A description of some of the algorithms in SymPy. The list is not
% exhaustive.

% The sections here are preliminary. We may end up needing to cut some of
% this.

% XXX: Perhaps this should just be integrated into the features section.

\subsection{Numerics}

\subsection{Polynomials}

\subsection{The Risch Algorithm}
% Also the Meijer-G algorithm, if someone can write about it

\subsection{The Gruntz Algorithm}

The limit modules implements the Gruntz algorithm
\cite{gruntz1996computing}.

Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
In [1]: limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)
Out[1]: 1

In [2]: limit((2*E**((1-cos(x))/sin(x))-1)**(sinh(x)/atan(x)**2), x, 0)
Out[2]: E
\end{verbatim}
