% A description of some of the algorithms in SymPy. The list is not
% exhaustive.

% The sections here are preliminary. We may end up needing to cut some of
% this.

% XXX: Perhaps this should just be integrated into the features section.

\subsection{Numerics}

\subsection{Polynomials}

\subsection{The Risch Algorithm}
% Also the Meijer-G algorithm, if someone can write about it

\subsection{The Gruntz Algorithm}

\subsection{Logic}

\subsection{Other}
