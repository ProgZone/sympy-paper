% symbols, various ways to declare them

All symbols in SymPy must be instantiated and assigned to a variable before
they can be used. This is typically done through the \texttt{symbols}
function, which creates multiple symbols at once. For instance,

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
\end{verbatim}

creates three symbols named \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and \texttt{z}, assigned
to Python variables of the same name. The Python variable names that symbols
are assigned to are immaterial---we could have just as well have written
\verb|a, b, c = symbol('x y z')|.

Expressions are created from symbols using Python syntax, which mirrors usual
mathematical notation. Note that in Python, exponentiation is \verb|**|.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> (x**2 - 2*x + 3)/y
(x**2 - 2*x + 3)/y
\end{verbatim}

% expand( ), factor( ), collect( ), together( ), apart( )
%% maybe a table best suits this part.

% simplification: simplify, sqrt denest, fu, trigsimp

The generic way to simplify an expression is by calling the \texttt{simplify}
function.
It must be emphasized that simplification is not an unambigously defined
mathematical operation~\cite{Carette2004understanding}.
The \texttt{simplify} function applies several simplification routines along
with some heuristics to make the output expression as ``simple'' as possible.

It is often preferable to apply more directed simplification functions. These
apply very specific rules to the input expression, and are often able to make
guarantees about the output (for instance, the \texttt{factor} function, given
a polynomial with rational coefficients in several variables, is guaranteed to
produce a factorization into irreducible factors).
Table~\ref{simplify-table} lists some common simplification functions.

% TODO: add a simple example for each
% TODO: fix the formatting
\label{simplify-table}
\begin{tabular}{l|p{0.7\linewidth}}
expand & expand the expression \\
factor & factor a polynomial into irreducibles \\
collect & collect polynomial coefficients \\
cancel & rewrite a rational function as $p/q$ with common factors canceled \\
apart & compute the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function \\
trigsimp & simplify trigonometric expressions~\cite{fu2006automated} \\
\end{tabular}

Substitutions are performed through the \texttt{.subs} method, which is
sensible to some mathematical properties while matching, such as
associativity, commutativity, additive and multiplicative inverses, and
matching of powers.

\subsubsection{Calculus}

% Calculus (differentiation, integration, limits). Note that algorithm
% descriptions will go in the algorithms section.

Derivatives can be computed with the \verb|diff| function.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> diff(sin(x), x)
cos(x)
\end{verbatim}

Unevaluated \verb|Derivative| objects are also supported.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> expr = Derivative(sin(x), x)
>>> expr
Derivative(sin(x), x)
\end{verbatim}

Unevaluated expressions can be evaluated with the \verb|doit| method.

\begin{verbatim}
In [5]: expr.doit()
Out[5]: cos(x)
\end{verbatim}

% TODO: A more interesting example here
Integrals can be analogously calculated either with the \verb|integrate|
function, or the unevaluated \verb|Integral| objects.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> integrate(sin(x), x)
-cos(x)
>>> expr = Integral(sin(x), x)
>>> expr
Integral(sin(x), x)
>>> expr.doit()
-cos(x)
\end{verbatim}
Definite integration can be calculated with the same method, by specifying a
range of the integration variable. The following computes $\int_0^1\sin(x)\,dx$.
\begin{verbatim}
>>> integrate(sin(x), (x, 0, 1))
-cos(1) + 1
\end{verbatim}

SymPy implements a combination of the Risch
algorithm~\cite{bronstein2005integration}, table lookups, a reimplementation
of Manuel Bronstein's ``Poor Man's Integrator''~\cite{Bronstein2005pmint}, and
an algorithm for computing integrals based on Meijer G-functions. These allow
SymPy to compute a wide variety of indefinite and definite integrals.
% TODO: What is the best citation for the Meijer G-function algorithm.
% TODO: Add some examples here.

Summations and products are also supported, via the evaluated \verb|summation|
and \verb|product| and unevaluated \verb|Sum| and \verb|Product|, and use the
same syntax as \verb|integrate|.

Summations are computed using a combination of Gosper's algorithm and an
algorithm that uses Meijer G-functions. Products are computed via some
heuristics.

\subsubsection{Expression outputs}

Alongside with its parsers, SymPy has a rich collection of expression printers.

% LaTeX printer
Expressions may be readily transformed into a LaTeX form with the \texttt{latex( )}
function.

% pretty printer
Pretty printer outputs the expression in traditional form with characters,
outputs can be visualized in monospace fonts.
