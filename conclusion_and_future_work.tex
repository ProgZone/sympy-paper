SymPy is a robust CAS that provides a wide array of features. It is written in
a general purpose programming language, Python, which allows it to be used in
a first-class way with other Python projects, including the scientific Python
stack. It is designed to be used in an extensible way. Unlike many other CASs,
it is designed to be used both as a end-user application and as a library.

The goal of SymPy is somewhat lofty: to be a full-featured CAS\@. However, a
few things sit at the head of the project's roadmap.

% Performance. Mention SymEngine.
