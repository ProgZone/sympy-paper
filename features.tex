\subsubsection{Series Expansion}

SymPy has several different implementations for representing series expansions.

\subsubsection{Formal Power Series}

SymPy can be used for computing the Formal Power Series of a function.
The implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paper on Formal Power Series\cite{Gruntz93formalpower}.
The advantage of this approach is that an explicit formula for the coefficients
of the series expansion is generated rather than just computing a few terms.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy import fps, symbols, sin
>>> x, y = symbols('x')
>>> f = fps(sin(x), x, x0=0)
>>> f.truncate(6)
x - x**3/6 + x**5/120 + O(x**6)
>>> f[15]
-x**15/1307674368000
\end{verbatim}
