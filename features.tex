% Features to discuss in-depth:

% Basic operations (the core)

% Calculus (differentiation, integration, limits). Integration and limits in particular have nontrivial algorithms behind them.

% Solvers (regular equations, maybe also mention other types of solvers like ODEs/recurrence/Diophantine)

% Matrices (worth including to stress that they are symbolic)

% Assumptions system (could also be part of the core)

% Logic (could also be part of the assumptions section)

% Physics module (some sampling, to show that it is there)

% Printing (results will be printed anyway, so it's worth mentioning it)

% Features to list, but not discuss in-depth:

% discrete math, concrete math, plotting, geometry, statistics, polys,
% combinatorics/group theory, code generation, lie algebras, cryptography,
% category theory, special functions, sets, matrix expressions, series, or
% vectors.
