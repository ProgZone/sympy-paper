SymPy was started by Ond\v{r}ej \v{C}ert\'{\i}k in 2005, and it has since
grown into a large project with over 500 contributors. SymPy is
developed on GitHub using a bazaar community
model~\cite{raymond1999cathedral}. The accessibility of the codebase and the
open community model allows SymPy to rapidly respond to the needs of the
community of users, and has made the large contributor count possible.

Python is a popular dynamically typed programming language that has a focus on
ease of use and readability. It also a very popular language for scientific
computing and data science, with a wide range of useful
libraries~\cite{oliphant2007python}. SymPy is itself used by many libraries
and tools across many domains, such as Sage~\cite{SAGE} (pure mathematics),
yt~\cite{2011ApJS..192....9T} (astronomy and astrophysics),
PyDy~\cite{gede2013constrained} (multibody dynamics), and
SfePy~\cite{cimrman2014sfepy} (finite elements).

Unlike many CASs, SymPy does not invent its own programming language. Python
itself is used both for the internal implementation and the end user
interaction.  The exclusive usage of one programming language makes it easier
for people already familiar with it to use or develop SymPy and at the same
time allows developers to focus on mathematics, rather than language design.

SymPy is designed with a strong focus on usability as a library. This
means that extensibility is important in its application program interface
(API) design. This is also one of the reasons SymPy makes no attempt to extend
the Python language itself. The goal is for users of SymPy to be able to
import SymPy alongside other Python libraries in their workflow, whether that
is an interactive workflow or programmatic use as part of a larger system.

Being developed as a library, SymPy does not have a built-in graphical user
interface (GUI). However, SymPy exposes a rich interactive display system,
including registering printers with Jupyter~\cite{perez2007ipython} frontends,
including the Notebook and Qt Console, which will pretty print SymPy
expressions using MathJax~\cite{cervone2012mathjax} or \LaTeX{} rendering.

Section~\ref{sec:architecture} discusses the architecture of SymPy.
Section~\ref{sec:features} enumerates the features of SymPy and takes a closer
look at some of the important ones. Following that, section~\ref{sec:numerics}
looks at the numerical features of SymPy and its dependency library, mpmath.
Section~\ref{sec:domain_specific} looks at the domain specific physics
submodules for doing classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Finally,
section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses future work.
