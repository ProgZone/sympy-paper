SymPy Live is an online Python shell, which runs on the Google
App Engine that executes SymPy code. It is integrated in the SymPy
documentation examples at \href{http://docs.sympy.org}{http://docs.sympy.org}.

This is accomplished by providing a HTML/JavaScript GUI for entering
source code and visualization of output, and a server that
evaluates the requested source code. It is an interactive AJAX shell
that runs SymPy code using Python on the server.
