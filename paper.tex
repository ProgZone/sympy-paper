%% Representing symbolic expressions using Python objects

Every symbolic expression in SymPy is an instance of a Python class.
Expressions are represented by expression trees. The operators is represented
by the type of an expression and the child nodes are stored in the
\texttt{args} attribute. A leaf node in the expression tree has an empty
\texttt{args}. For example, take the expression $xy + 2$.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x, y = symbols('x y')
>>> expr = x*y + 2
\end{verbatim}

The expression \texttt{expr} is an addition, so it is of type \texttt{Add}. The child
nodes of \texttt{expr} are \texttt{x*y} and \texttt{2}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(expr)
<class 'sympy.core.add.Add'>
>>> expr.args
(2, x*y)
\end{verbatim}

We can dig further into the expression tree to see the full expression. For
example, the first child node, given by \texttt{expr.args[0]} is
\texttt{2}. Its class is \texttt{Integer}, and it has empty \texttt{args},
indicating that it is a leaf node

\begin{verbatim}
>>> expr.args[0]
2
>>> type(expr.args[0])
<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Integer'>
>>> expr.args[0].args
()
\end{verbatim}

Every SymPy expression satisfies a key invariant, namely,
\texttt{expr.func(*expr.args) == expr}. This means that expressions are
rebuildable from their \texttt{args}\footnote{\texttt{expr.func} is used
  instead of \texttt{type(expr)} to allow the function of an expression to be
  distinct from its actual Python class. In most cases the two are the same.}.
Here, we note that in SymPy, the \texttt{==} operator represents exact
structural equality, not mathematical equality. This allows us to test if any
two expressions are equal to one another as expression trees.
