\section{Comments from Editor}

\begin{questions}
\question I found the \url{http://live.sympy.org/} site very convenient for trying things
out in SymPy, but it is only mentioned in the supplement, which might be
overlooked by readers. I suggest moving that section into the main paper, as
it provides a great way to play along with the examples while reading the
paper.
\begin{solution}
  % TODO
\end{solution}
\question The Basic Usage section omits what I think is an important point:
how does one distinguish between evaluating exp(1) in Python and exp(1) in
SymPy? In other words, how are symbolic constants specified?
\begin{solution}
  % TODO. I'm unclear what the editor is asking here.
\end{solution}
\question The first
thing I tried after seeing Table 2 (simplication functions) did not work:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> trigsimp (exp( Matrix(2, 2, [0, -y, y, 0])) )
\end{verbatim}
fails to recognize cos and
sin. Am I expecting too much?
\begin{solution}
  This indeed does not work. The implementation in \verb|trigsimp| primarily
  thus far has focused on transforming trigonometric functions into other
  trigonometric functions. The ability to simplify complex exponentials is
  something that we would like to work.
  \href{https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11459}{Issue 11459} in our
  public issue tracker tracks this feature.
\end{solution}
\question Section 3.6: are eigenvalues and singular
values included? If not, why not?
\begin{solution}
  % TODO
\end{solution}
\question Like one of the referees, I expected to
see MPFR mentioned in Section 4.1, at least to mention the pros and cons and
say why it isn’t used.
\begin{solution}
  % TODO
\end{solution}
\question Section 4.1: please state whether the syntax for
functions in mpmath is identical, or not, to that in Sympy.
\begin{solution}
  % TODO
\end{solution}
\question Unless I have
missed something, a weakness of the paper is that speed is mentioned only
twice, on lines 496 and 666. My assumption is that SymPy is slow compared with
its commercial competitors. Please comment on the speed issue, and not just in
the conclusions.
\begin{solution}
  % TODO
\end{solution}
\question Editors are needed for [20].
\begin{solution}
  % TODO: I do not know how to make bibtex (with apalike) show the editor
  % here.
\end{solution}
\end{questions}

\section{Reviewer 1 (James Davenport)}
\subsection{Basic reporting}
\begin{questions}
\question Generally good. A part that confused me is the assertion (footnote 3) that "If
A and B are Symbols created with commutative=False then SymPy will keep A·B
and B·A distinct." Does that mean that BOTH of them must be created this way,
and that A and x (if x is created normally) will commute? Is there any way to
declare commutators? How does one guarantee that other pieces of code, e.g.
Gaussian elimination, respect non-commutativity?
\begin{solution}
  % TODO.
\end{solution}

\question References reasonable, though [8], an excellent reference, makes almost
precisely the opposite point to that for which it is cited --- ``simplification
is not well-defined''. I think the authors are trying to follow [8]'s
definition of simplification.
\begin{solution}
  % TODO. I agree that [8] is a bad reference, because we are not actually
  % using their definition. The aim was just to have a reference for
  % "simplification is not well-defined", but that paper aims to define it.
  % What is a better reference here? Perhaps Moses [19] from the Carette
  % paper? Perhaps we can remove the reference (the referenced statement is
  % "it must be emphasized that simplification is not a rigorously defined
  % mathematical operation").
\end{solution}
\end{questions}

\subsection{Experimental design}
\begin{questions}
\question The referee is asked to comment whether the research is withinthe scope of the
journal, defined as "PeerJ is an Open Access, peer-reviewed, scholarly
journal. It considers articles in the Biological Sciences, Medical Sciences,
and Health Sciences. PeerJ does not publish in the Physical Sciences, the
Mathematical Sciences, the Social Sciences, or the Humanities (except where
articles in those areas have clear applicability to the core areas of
Biological, Medical or Health sciences)."

Hence I fear a software description on the maths/cmputing boundary with no
cited applications is out of scope.

\begin{solution}
  The editor has confirmed that the paper is in scope for PeerJ Computer Science.
\end{solution}
\end{questions}

\subsection{Validity of the findings}
\begin{questions}
\question There are no findings as such, since this is a software description, not an
experimental paper.
\end{questions}

\subsection{Comments for the author}
\begin{questions}
\question Nice paper - pity it seems totally out of scope. Why not J. Symbolic
Computation or some such?
\begin{solution}
  See above.
\end{solution}
\end{questions}
