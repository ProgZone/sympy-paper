\section{Comments from Editor}

\begin{questions}
\question  In section 2.3, lines 128â€“129, it is written
\begin{quote}
For instance, the identity $\sqrt{t^2} = t$ holds if $t$ is nonnegative ($t \geq
0$). However, for general complex $t$, no such identity holds.
\end{quote}
The first sentence doesn't make sense unless $\sqrt{\cdot}$ is defined;
obviously it is intended to yield the nonnegative square root. The second
sentence is incorrect, so needs rewording or deleting. For complex $t$ it is
true that $\sqrt{t^2} = t$ holds if $t$ lies in the right half-plane, assuming
$\sqrt{\cdot}$ is defined to be the square root lying in the right half-plane.

\question Page 7, line 186: please state in the text whether this is typed as two lower case letter o's, as opposed to being some special symbol.
\begin{solution}
We have added a note here.
\end{solution}

\question Page 10, line 315: replace ``solving'' by ``finding its zeros''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Page 18, line 684: replace ``is as performant as'' by ``performs as well as''. The former is not correct English.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Reference [42]: the title and publisher appear to have run together.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Supplement, line 1: delete ``for''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Supplement, line 18: ``dependends'' $\rightarrow$ ``depends''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

This is a great paper. Thank you for addressing my concerns.

\section{Comments from Reviewer 3}
\subsection{Basic reporting}
The structure of the paper and the supplement is now improved, compared to the original submission, and the materials are now much easier to read and comprehend.

\subsubsection{The paper}

\begin{questions}
\question The abstract and the paper itself mention the paper's supplement in several places. I believe it would be beneficial to add a short paragraph, possibly after line 90, that would list the supplement's contents in a manner similar to that of the paper's contents (lines 83--90), with the list submodules, to make it easier for an interested reader to find their way around it.

\question In line 323, it should say ``\ldots meaning that the entries\ldots''.

\question In line 673, it should say either ``poorer than that of its commercial competitors'' or ``poorer than its commercial competitors''' (ending in apostrophe).

\question In line 813, one ``PhD thesis'' seems to be superficial.

\subsubsection{The supplement}

\question Figure 1 is hard to read. I suggest putting the labels on the outside of the loops.

\question Figure 2 has the wrong link towards SymPy Gamma's computation of $\tan(x)$
 instead of $\int \tan(x)\,dx$.
