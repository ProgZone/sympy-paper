\section{Comments from Editor}

\begin{questions}
\question  In section 2.3, lines 128â€“129, it is written
\begin{quote}
For instance, the identity $\sqrt{t^2} = t$ holds if $t$ is nonnegative ($t \geq
0$). However, for general complex $t$, no such identity holds.
\end{quote}
The first sentence doesn't make sense unless $\sqrt{\cdot}$ is defined;
obviously it is intended to yield the nonnegative square root. The second
sentence is incorrect, so needs rewording or deleting. For complex $t$ it is
true that $\sqrt{t^2} = t$ holds if $t$ lies in the right half-plane, assuming
$\sqrt{\cdot}$ is defined to be the square root lying in the right half-plane.

\question Page 7, line 186: please state in the text whether this is typed as two lower case letter o's, as opposed to being some special symbol.
\begin{solution}
We have added a note here.
\end{solution}

\question Page 10, line 315: replace ``solving'' by ``finding its zeros''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Page 18, line 684: replace ``is as performant as'' by ``performs as well as''. The former is not correct English.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Reference [42]: the title and publisher appear to have run together.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Supplement, line 1: delete ``for''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
\end{solution}

\question Supplement, line 18: ``dependends'' $\rightarrow$ ``depends''.
\begin{solution}
We have fixed this.
