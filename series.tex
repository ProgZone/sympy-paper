\subsubsection{Series Expansion}

SymPy has several different implementations for representing series expansions.

TODO

\subsubsection{Formal Power Series}

SymPy can be used for computing the Formal Power Series of a function.
The implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paper on Formal Power Series\cite{Gruntz93formalpower}.
The advantage of this approach is that an explicit formula for the coefficients
of the series expansion is generated rather than just computing a few terms.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy import fps, symbols, sin
>>> x, y = symbols('x')
>>> f = fps(sin(x), x, x0=0)
>>> f.truncate(6)
x - x**3/6 + x**5/120 + O(x**6)
>>> f[15]
-x**15/1307674368000
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Fourier Series}

SymPy provides functionality to compute Fourier Series of a function using
the \texttt{fourier_series} function. Under the hood it just computes $a0$, $an$, $bn$ using
standard integration formulas.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy import fourier_series, symbols, Heaviside
>>> x, L = symbols('x L')
>>> f = fourier_series(2 * (Heaviside(x/L) - Heaviside(x/L - 1)) - 1, (x, 0, 2*L))
>>> f.truncate(3)
4*sin(pi*x/L)/pi + 4*sin(3*pi*x/L)/(3*pi) + 4*sin(5*pi*x/L)/(5*pi)
\end{verbatim}
