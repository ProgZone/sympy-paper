%% Sets SymPy

SymPy supports representation of a wide variety of set, this is achieved by
first defining abstract representation for a smaller number of sets in form of
python classes and then combining and transforming them using various set
operations.

%% Set Types

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite Set
    \item Empty Set
    \item Universal Set
    \item Real Interval
    \item Finite and Infinite Range
    \item Complex Region
\end{itemize}


%% Operations

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite Union
    \item Finite Intersection
    \item Set Difference
    \item Product Set
    \item Image Set
    \item Condition Set
\end{itemize}

%% Representations acheivable through application of Operations on atomic set
%% types mentioned above.
