The generic way to simplify an expression is by calling the \texttt{simplify}
function.
It must be emphasized that simplification is not a rigorously defined
mathematical operation~\cite{Carette2004understanding}.
The \texttt{simplify} function applies several simplification routines along
with heuristics to make the output expression as ``simple'' as possible.

It is often preferable to apply more directed simplification functions. These
apply very specific rules to the input expression and are typically able to make
guarantees about the output. For instance, the \texttt{factor} function,
given a polynomial with rational coefficients in several variables,
is guaranteed to
produce a factorization into irreducible factors. Table~\ref{simplify-table}
lists common simplification functions.
