%% Solvers in SymPy

There are two submodules to solve equations in SymPy, referred to as old solve
i.e. \texttt{solve} and new solve i.e. \texttt{solveset}. There are several
design changes in \texttt{solveset} to resolve the issues with old solve, for
example old \texttt{solve}'s input API has many flags which are not needed and
they make it hard for the user and the developers to work on solvers. In
contrast to old solve, the \texttt{solveset} has a clean input API, It only
asks for the much needed information from the user, following are the function
signatures of old and new solve:

\begin{verbatim}
    solve(f, *symbols, **flags)  # Old Solve
    solveset(f, symbol, domain)  # New Solve
\end{verbatim}
