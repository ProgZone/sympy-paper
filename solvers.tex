%% Solvers in SymPy

SymPy has a solvers module to solve equations symbolically. There are two
submodules to solve equations in SymPy, referred to as old solve i.e.
\texttt{solve} and new solve i.e. \texttt{solveset}. Solveset is introduced
with several design changes with respect to old \texttt{solve} to resolve the
issues with old \texttt{solve}, for example old \texttt{solve}'s input API has
many flags which are not needed and they make it hard for the user and the
developers to work on solvers. In contrast to old solve, the \texttt{solveset}
has a clean input API, It only asks for the much needed information from the
user, following are the function signatures of old and new solve:

\begin{verbatim}
    solve(f, *symbols, **flags)  # Old Solve
    solveset(f, symbol, domain)  # New Solve
\end{verbatim}

The old \texttt{solve} has an inconsistent output API for various types of
inputs, whereas the \texttt{solveset} has a canonical output API using sets.
It can consistently output various types of solutions.
